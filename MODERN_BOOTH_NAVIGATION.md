# Modern Photobooth Navigation Setup

## What Was Added

### 1. Surface Home Screen Entry
A new navigation card has been added to the Surface home screen for the Modern Photobooth interface:
- **Location**: Between "Photo Booth" and "Events" cards
- **Title**: "Modern Booth"
- **Subtitle**: "Modular interface"
- **Icon**: ✨ (sparkles emoji)
- **Color**: Gradient from pink (#FF4081) to purple (#7C4DFF) to cyan (#00BCD4)

### 2. True Fullscreen Window
Created a dedicated fullscreen window for the modern interface:
- **File**: `Windows/ModernPhotoboothWindow.xaml` and `.xaml.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Launches in true fullscreen (no window chrome, no taskbar)
  - Press ESC to show exit button (auto-hides after 5 seconds)
  - Press F11 to toggle fullscreen mode
  - Hides cursor automatically for kiosk mode

### 3. Navigation Handler
Added click handler in `SurfacePhotoBoothWindow.xaml.cs`:
- **Method**: `NavigateToPhotoBoothModern_Click`
- Opens the modern interface in a separate fullscreen window
- Minimizes the Surface window to get out of the way
