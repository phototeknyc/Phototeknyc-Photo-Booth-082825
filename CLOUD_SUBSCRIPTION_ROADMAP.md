# Cloud Subscription Implementation Roadmap

## 📋 Overview
This document tracks the implementation of cloud sync, subscription management, and analytics for the Photobooth application. We're starting small with a minimal viable product (MVP) approach.

## 🎯 Business Goals
- Launch with minimal infrastructure cost (<$50/month for first 10 clients)
- Achieve 70%+ gross margins from day one
- Scale efficiently as we grow
- Maintain offline-first functionality

## 💰 Pricing Strategy
- **Basic**: $29/month (500 photos, 30-day retention)
- **Pro**: $79/month (2000 photos, 90-day retention, analytics)
- **Enterprise**: $199/month (unlimited, BYOS option, white-label)

## 📊 Phase 0: Current State (COMPLETED)
✅ Desktop photobooth application working
✅ Local photo storage and session management
✅ Basic settings and templates
✅ Camera integration (Canon, Nikon, etc.)
✅ PIN security for settings
✅ Modern touch interface
✅ GIF replaced with MP4 video generation
