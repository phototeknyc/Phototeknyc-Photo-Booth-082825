# Printer Pooling Guide for High-Volume Events

## Overview
Printer pooling allows multiple printers to work together as a team, dramatically increasing print speed for high-volume photobooth events. Instead of one printer handling all jobs, the system automatically distributes prints across 2-4 printers.

## Benefits
- **3-4x faster printing** - Multiple printers working simultaneously
- **Automatic failover** - If one printer fails, others continue
- **Even wear distribution** - Extends printer lifespan
- **No manual intervention** - Fully automated job distribution
- **Smart load balancing** - Prevents printer overload

## Configuration

### Step 1: Enable Pooling
1. Open **Settings** → **Print Settings**
2. Find your printer section (Default or 2x6 Strip)
3. Check **"Enable Pooling"** checkbox
4. Pool options appear below

### Step 2: Select Distribution Strategy

#### Round-Robin (Recommended for most events)
- Distributes jobs evenly in sequence
- Printer 1 → Printer 2 → Printer 3 → Printer 4 → repeat
- Best for: Equal job sizes, predictable distribution

#### Load Balance (For varying job complexity)
- Sends each job to printer with shortest queue
- Monitors printer workload in real-time
- Best for: Mixed print sizes, varying processing times

#### Failover Only (Maximum reliability)
- Uses primary printer for all jobs
- Additional printers activate only if primary fails
- Best for: Critical events, primary printer preference

### Step 3: Add Pool Printers
1. Check the box next to **Printer 2**, **Printer 3**, or **Printer 4**
2. Select the printer from the dropdown
3. Can use identical printers (e.g., 3x DNP DS40) or different models
4. Each printer uses its own DEVMODE settings

## Example Configurations

### Wedding Reception (200+ guests)
```
Default Printer Pool:
☑ Enable Pooling
Primary: DNP DS40 #1
Strategy: Round-Robin
☑ Printer 2: DNP DS40 #2
☑ Printer 3: DNP DS40 #3

Result: 3x faster printing, ~20 seconds per guest instead of 60
```

### Corporate Event (Mixed formats)
```
Default Printer Pool:
☑ Enable Pooling
Primary: Canon SELPHY
Strategy: Load Balance
☑ Printer 2: DNP DS620
☑ Printer 3: DNP RX1

2x6 Strip Pool:
☑ Enable Pooling  
Primary: DNP DS40 #1
Strategy: Round-Robin
☑ Printer 2: DNP DS40 #2
```

### School Prom (High volume, identical printers)
```
Default Printer Pool:
☑ Enable Pooling
Primary: DNP DS620 #1
Strategy: Round-Robin
☑ Printer 2: DNP DS620 #2
☑ Printer 3: DNP DS620 #3
☑ Printer 4: DNP DS620 #4

Result: 4x throughput, handle 240 prints/hour
```

## How It Works

### Round-Robin Distribution
```
Job 1 → Printer #1 (printing...)
Job 2 → Printer #2 (printing...)
Job 3 → Printer #3 (printing...)
Job 4 → Printer #4 (printing...)
Job 5 → Printer #1 (ready again)
Job 6 → Printer #2 (ready again)
...continues cycling...
```

### Load Balance Distribution
```
Job 1 → Printer #1 (1 job in queue)
Job 2 → Printer #2 (0 jobs - least busy)
Job 3 → Printer #3 (0 jobs - least busy)
Job 4 → Printer #2 (now ready, 0 jobs)
Job 5 → Printer #3 (now ready, 0 jobs)
...distributes based on availability...
```

### Automatic Failover
If Printer #2 jams or goes offline:
- System detects failure immediately
- Removes Printer #2 from pool
- Continues with remaining printers
- No interruption to service
- Alert shown in status

## Setup Tips

### Hardware Setup
1. **USB Hubs**: Use powered USB 3.0 hubs for multiple printers
2. **Power**: Ensure adequate power - use separate circuits if needed
3. **Space**: Allow ventilation between printers
4. **Media**: Keep extra media ready for quick changes
5. **Cable Management**: Label cables clearly

### Optimal Printer Placement
```
[Computer/Kiosk]
       |
   [USB Hub]
   /   |   \
  P1   P2   P3
```

### Media Management
- Load identical media in all pool printers
- For DNP printers: Use same ribbon/paper combinations
- Keep spare media nearby for quick swaps
- Consider different capacity rolls (e.g., 400 vs 700 prints)

## Performance Expectations

### Single Printer
- DNP DS40: ~60 seconds per 4x6 print
- Throughput: ~60 prints/hour

### With Pooling (3 printers)
- Effective speed: ~20 seconds per print
- Throughput: ~180 prints/hour
- 3x faster!

### With Pooling (4 printers)
- Effective speed: ~15 seconds per print
- Throughput: ~240 prints/hour
- 4x faster!

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Status Indicators
- Each printer shows job count
- Failed printers marked offline
- Queue length visible per printer

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Uneven distribution?**
- Check all printers have same media
- Verify USB connections are stable
- Consider switching to Load Balance strategy

**One printer not receiving jobs?**
- Check printer is online and ready
- Verify printer selected in pool dropdown
- Test printer individually

**Slower than expected?**
- Ensure all printers using USB 3.0
- Check printer driver settings match
- Verify media type is consistent

## Advanced Features

### Mixed Printer Types
You can pool different printer models:
- Fast printer for priority jobs
- Slower printers for overflow
- Use Load Balance strategy for best results

### Dual Format Pooling
Run two separate pools simultaneously:
- Default pool for 4x6, 5x7, 8x10
- Strip pool for 2x6 strips
- Each with independent settings

### Statistics Tracking
System tracks per printer:
- Total jobs printed
- Current queue length
- Success/failure rates
- Average print time

## Best Practices

1. **Test Before Event**
   - Run test prints through all pool printers
   - Verify distribution strategy works
   - Check failover by disconnecting one printer

2. **Same Model Preferred**
   - Using identical printers ensures consistent output
   - Simplifies media management
   - Predictable timing

3. **Monitor First Hour**
   - Watch distribution pattern
   - Check for any printer issues
   - Adjust strategy if needed

4. **Have Backup Plan**
   - Keep one printer outside pool as emergency backup
   - Extra media and ribbons ready
   - Know how to quickly disable pooling if needed

## Quick Reference

| Strategy | Best For | Distribution | Failover |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Round-Robin | Most events | Even, predictable | Automatic |
| Load Balance | Mixed jobs | Based on queue | Automatic |
| Failover | Reliability | Primary only | Secondary activate on failure |

## Capacity Planning

| Event Size | Recommended Setup | Expected Throughput |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 50-100 guests | 1 printer (no pool) | 60 prints/hour |
| 100-200 guests | 2 printer pool | 120 prints/hour |
| 200-400 guests | 3 printer pool | 180 prints/hour |
| 400+ guests | 4 printer pool | 240 prints/hour |

The printer pooling system transforms your photobooth into a high-capacity printing station perfect for large events!
